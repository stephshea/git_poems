The poem

git checkout -b <branch_name>

(add to branch)

from branch
git add .
git commit -m '  '
git push

git checkout master
git merge <branch_name>
git push origin master

cool words
another cool word
clever ending

made a branch change for first branch
made a change in the second branch
made a change in third branch
